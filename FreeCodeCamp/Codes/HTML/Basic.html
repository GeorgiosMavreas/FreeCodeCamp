    <!--You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.
Note that img elements are self-closing.
All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility 
and is displayed if the image fails to load.
Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.
Ideally the alt attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.
Let's add an alt attribute to our img example above:-->
    <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

    <main>
        <img src="G:\FreeCodeCamp\images\your-image.jpg" alt="My Cat"><br><a href="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com"
            target="_blank">cat photos</a>
        <p>
            Kitty psum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed
            everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

        <!--Create a Form Element.
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this 
by specifying an action attribute on your form element.-->
        <form action="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">

            
            <!--Create a Set of Radio Buttons.
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.
Radio buttons are a type of input.
Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label 
element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, 
selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one 
answer is provided by the user.
It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the id 
attribute of the input element. 
This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the related input element-->

<!--Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes.
When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of type 
radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.-->

<!--Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default.
You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.
To do this, just add the word checked to the inside of an input element.-->

           <label for="indoor">Indoor  &nbsp;   
                <input type="radio" value="indoor" name="indoor-outdoor" id="indoor" checked>
            </label><br>

            <label for="outdoor">Outdoor
                <input type="radio" value="outdoor" name="indoor-outdoor" id="outdoor">
            </label><br>

            <!--Create a Set of Checkboxes.
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.
Checkboxes are a type of input.
Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element 
it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.
All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.
It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding label by 
setting the for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.
Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the indoor option selected, the form data 
will include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor. This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.
If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario, 
if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, 
which is not useful. So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.-->

            <label for="loving">Loving &nbsp;
                <input type="checkbox" value="loving" name="personality" id="loving" checked>
            </label><br>

            <label for="carrying">Lazy
                <input type="checkbox" value="lazy" name="personality" id="lazy">
            </label><br>

            <label for="sensitive">Energetic
                <input type="checkbox" value="energetic" name="personality" id="energetic">
            </label><br><br>

            <!--Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field
Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.-->

            <!--Use HTML5 to Require a Field.
You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.
For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element, 
like this: <input type="text" required>-->

<input type="text" name="" id="" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>

<!--Add a Submit Button to a Form
Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with 
your form's action attribute.-->

<button type="submit">Submit</button><br>

        </form>
    </main>
